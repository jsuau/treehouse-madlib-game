This exercise is based on a Treehouse course on JS.

# User story:

Create a game where a user inputs a noun, a verb and two adjectives. Store these inputs in variables and output them in a message that's a paragraph in the / <main> tag.
  
 In details, you'll need to:
 
 1. Declare four variables and capture input.
 2. Combine the input with other words to create a sentence.
 3. Display the sentence as a <p> tag inside the <main> element.
